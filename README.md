[Team Charter]
The purpose of this team is to produce a game or level utalizing a Top-Down perseptive. 

So far our teams communication has been through email but we have other forms of contact if needed like text messaging through the phone.

We have been communicating every few days due to are busy schedules. It seems the weekend is a good time for us to figure out what to work on throughout the week.

[Project Vison and Goals]
The Project is in a Beta faze as the team is currently making plans and figuring out what we want to do for the final project.

The Project would be in its Alpha faze when the idea becomes more relized with a game and code being developed.

We have come together and decided that we want to make a Top-Down Game with a Medieval theme. Are inspiration is old tower defence games like Plants vs Zombies and a flash game called Dungeon Defender.

## Module Three Team Development: QA and Testing Plan
To test out our project we will assign a member to become a game tester. They will play the game to detect any errors or bugs the players could come into contact with. 

[How we should Test It? / Reported]
I believe it would be a good idea that every time the project is commited or updated to have the Game tester go through and mark down any problems they come across that can be fixed before the next commit. The Tester can make a word doc or an additional section in the ReadMe for the others in the team to seem exacatly what is wrong and where the problem occured. The Tester will not only have to check out the objects and levels made for the game but the code as one simple mistake can be disaterous to the development of the project.
//side note I have created an aditional file for the game tester to input any issues they run into so the whole team can view it.

//Michael - added after the repo was fixed
I believe when it comes to testing anything that getting as many sets of eyes on the test build is the best way to ensure as many bugs are caught as possible. I've gone ahead and volunteered myself as the lead tester but I would also like that all three of us at least take a brief look over major builds as we progress for anything that might have been missed. I plan to thoroughly check over every aspect of the game as lead tester as even one small error can be a huge detriment to the final product. I also plan to make a checklist to go through each testing phase to keep track of where improvements are needed in a neat and orderly manner.

[Schedule]
We will constantly play test the game during the preproduction to make sure the game runs smoothly. While we might miss some things like every game company in the world, we will create a Demo for players to test out and give feedback. This allows us to make changes and fix any problems before a full release. 

## Module Four Team Refelction

What went Well?
Nick created a Top-Down player character. He used the help of one of Unreal Engines test projects to get an idea of how it should work. The player character features two forms of movement options with the keyboard/mouse and a fire action. The first movement is keyboard inputs that utalize W,A,S,D to point the player in a certain direction. The secound player movement is a rotation. The Player character follows the mouse around the screen. A fire action activated by the left mouse click is used with the rotation of the player so the projectile that was added can hit the enemies. The enemy characters will follow the player across the map and if they come in contact with the player the player get destroyed. If the projectile makes contact with the enemy first then the enemy is destroyed.

//Michael
Michael got access to the build of what Nick created after gaining access to the new repo. After briefly testing the build, a few bugs were noted and quickly fixed by Nick while working on the project and during the brief test, no more major bugs or issues were found. The player character moved without issue, following the mouse around the screen and fires without issue using the left mouse click. 

What would you do differently?:
I would like to try and make sure I have more time to work on the project. I dont want to have this project in the back of my mind and have to rush certain parts to make sure it gets done just because the rest of my life is a bit busy. I want to implement some possible animations to go along with the fire machanic and have some variation in enemy types. The map needs to have some scenery so it doesnt look so bland but I just wanted to make sure there was some gameplay to give the project life.

//Michael
I was unaware there was an issue with the previous repo and found out about the new one far too late in the week because of illness. I'd like for myself to check on these things more, even if I'm busy with other classwork or not feeling my best. I'm not usually the type to like working in a team and truly am not good at communication which is something I need to massively improve. I'd like to be able to spend some time adding some small bits details, something I can't do if I let myself drag behind.

Possible Bugs
A bug that was fixed in a matter of minutes was the inputs for the directions being wrong or backwards. It was eventually fixed by adjusting the code to send the right inputs when certain buttons were pressed. It was a simple mistake that could have messed up the team when testing a level layout in the future.
The one of the issues that we expierenced was a lighting glitch which has been solved. The lights won't work when the level is played but I eventually relized that I acidently removed the object that made the light. While it may not have been a bug it was still an issue that was overcome.
When making the projectile for the player character the object wouldnt fire. It turns out a bit of the code I made was wrong but got it fixed and the correct mesh wasnt applied so it wasnt appearing when fired.

//Michael
When I booted up the build for a brief test I didn't notice any issues and all of the bugs Nick mentioned seemed to be fixed. I'll do a more in-depth look in the near future to catch any bugs that may have been missed before Nick or I add anything major.

Helpful tools:
The use of youtube and looking at the basic Unreal Projects that are provided help Nick out when he is working. They give him a clear view of what he is supposed to do or how to fix an issues that he has run into. Youtube supplies many videos and tutorials on how to get any idea for the project to be functional. These videos come in handy just in case the user forgets how to do something in unreal engine. 

//Michael
The most helpful tool for me is my second monitor. Having access to multiple windows at once makes following a video guide or checking a list much easier.

Not so Helpful tools:
So far I havent found any tools that where not helpful in some fashion to me. 

//Michael
I also haven't found any non-useful tools
